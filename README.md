For my creative component, I added parsed and grabbed the alt image tab for the open graph meta tag. I believe that it's a good addition because it improves accessiblity of the website. Example: https://ischool.uw.edu

For layout, I stretched out the block to fill up more space and centered the objects within the block. It helps the layout because if it was in a smaller block then it would feel like the web page provides more websites rather than just one. 


This is the link to the deploy website: https://tasty-bat-bonnet.cyclic.app/

Creative Component is allowing users to type in how they found the website.
